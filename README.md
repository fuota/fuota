Hi guys!!
It's my totally new journey of learning to code.
I used to keep the stereotype that girls should follow careers that are not related to engineering. That's why I decided to choose Finance instead of Engineering. It took me two years to experience and realize my strengths and weaknesses. And, now...Here I am, embarking on studying programming myself and officially majoring in Computer Science at college. (Girls can code, right?)
This GitHub was established at the beginning of my learning Web Development. If you have interest in my projects or have any questions, just contact me via phuongtam1072@gmail.com
